# Examples

For now, there is only one toy example, 'hello`.

Examples can get complicated and put pressure on a simple project to become complicated by way of forcing it to incorporate examples into its organization and eventual manifestation.

How many examples going beyond the toy code that reveals something about Docker would be organized to separate out examples from featureful code is fraught, so some thought is being given to expanding examples with explainer versions of the entire project code, each version maybe separately forkable as worked starters relevant to specialized use case.

Contributory suggestions are welcome.

For now, future examples might include:

- configure gunicorn to run an ASGI application with uvicorn workers
- manage Python imports and the implications thereof by way of initial folder and module organization
- showing where your virtual environment goes -- if it hasn't already wrapped the entire project by this point
- configure reverse proxies for upstreams
- configure for specific Python frameworks in yet another stack hack repo, distro, io...
- configure proxies and params for GO, PHP, Ruby, Node, etc.
- what is dhparam and why and how to use it?
- ... 

Lots of other things to do though, so please don't hold your breath.

Let me get a handle on spelling and grammar and maybe then...

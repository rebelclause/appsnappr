Using environment variables in nginx configuration (new in 1.19)

Out-of-the-box, nginx doesn't support environment variables inside most configuration blocks. But this image has a function, which will extract environment variables before nginx starts.

Here is an example using docker-compose.yml:

web:
  image: nginx
  volumes:
   - ./templates:/etc/nginx/templates
  ports:
   - "8080:80"
  environment:
   - NGINX_HOST=foobar.com
   - NGINX_PORT=80

By default, this function reads template files in /etc/nginx/templates/*.template and outputs the result of executing envsubst to /etc/nginx/conf.d.

So if you place templates/default.conf.template file, which contains variable references like this:

listen       ${NGINX_PORT};

outputs to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf like this:

listen       80;

This behavior can be changed via the following environment variables:

    NGINX_ENVSUBST_TEMPLATE_DIR
        A directory which contains template files (default: /etc/nginx/templates)
        When this directory doesn't exist, this function will do nothing about template processing.
    NGINX_ENVSUBST_TEMPLATE_SUFFIX
        A suffix of template files (default: .template)
        This function only processes the files whose name ends with this suffix.
    NGINX_ENVSUBST_OUTPUT_DIR
        A directory where the result of executing envsubst is output (default: /etc/nginx/conf.d)
        The output filename is the template filename with the suffix removed.
            ex.) /etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template will be output with the filename /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf.
        This directory must be writable by the user running a container.

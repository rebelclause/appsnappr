# Majority of this file, thanks to: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore

# If you're creating virtual environments for Python projects, please refrain from using .env.
# .env is inextricably linked to native Docker functionality by docker-compose, providing all service template variables.
# Secrets, on the other hand, are embedded in environment by way of files referenced under a service's key 'env_file:' where the listing order determines overrides. Keep your secrets in a .secret file, and this .gitignore will prevent these from being swept up into a repository. The alternative is bleak, as deleting commits is hard, getting worse the more contributors you have across various distributed states; an earlier pull request may lead through a commit to having those secrets thought to be deleted right back in the git history. Beware!

# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.

#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
